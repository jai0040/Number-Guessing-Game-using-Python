*About project*
To create a guessing game, we need to write a program to select a random number between 1 and 10. To give hints to the user, we can use conditional statements to tell the user if the guessed number is smaller, greater than or equal to the randomly selected number.

So in python file how you can write a program to create a number guessing game using Python:

Example of Output:-
    Enter any number: 2
    Too low
    Enter number again: 5
    Too low
    Enter number again: 8
    you guessed it right!!

If the guessed number is lower than the randomly selected number, the user will see “too low”. If the guessed number is higher than the randomly selected number, the user will see “too high”. When the user guesses the correct number, “you guessed it right!!” will be displayed in the output.


*Summary*
So this is how you can write a program to create a guessing game using Python. It is a popular game among programmers. In this game, the program selects a random number between two numbers, and the user guesses the correct number. I hope you liked this article on how to create a guessing game using Python.
